# OpenWeatherMap module for Pext
This module allows [Pext](https://github.com/Pext/Pext) to retrieve weather
information from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/).

As OpenWeatherMap requires an API key, one has been included with the module
for evaluation and testing purposes. The included API key may stop working at
any time. Please [request](http://openweathermap.org/appid) and use your own
API key whenever possible.

The included city.list.json file is taken from http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/.
